# conventions are a strong, cheap, complementary signal to the statistical
# fidelity/novelty/diversity evaluation: they catch cases the statistics
# genuinely can't discriminate (e.g. a column with a small realistic

# having to rely on the generator library's own internal naming, which
# rarely matches real-world column names anyway.
