datafaker
---------------------------

**datafaker** is a package for making copies of relational databases and populating them with random data.

If you are new to datafaker, we recommend going through the pages of this documentation roughly in order:
After :ref:`installing <page-installation>` datafaker and learning the basic commands that it uses from the :ref:`quick start guide <page-quickstart>`, the :ref:`introductory tutorial <page-introduction>` will walk you through a relatively simple use case in detail.
You can then look at one of our other two example use cases, one for :ref:`financial data <page-example-loan-data>` and one for :ref:`health data <page-example-health-data>`.
The latter also goes through some more advanced features of datafaker and how to use them, that are relevant beyond health data use cases.
