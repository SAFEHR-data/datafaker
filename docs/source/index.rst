---------

**Datafaker** is a package for generating synthetic versions of relational and tabular datasets. 
It can work with relational databases as well as Parquet files through DuckDB integration. 

If you are new to Datafaker, we recommend following the documentation in order: start with the :ref:`Installation <page-installation>` guide and learn the basic commands that Datafaker uses from the :ref:`Command-Line Interface (CLI) Guide <page-quickstart>`. 
Then, work through the :ref:`Tutorials <page-introduction>` before exploring the example use cases and reference documentation.
